I"*<p>These last days I saw a tweet talking about <a href="https://frontincampinas.com.br/">Front in Campinas</a>. The conference has everything to be amazing, and I’m strongly thinking to send a talk’s proposal.</p>

<p>So, I accessed the website and then I saw was the logo. The first thing I thought: “Could I do this one using only CSS? And maybe, only one <code class="highlighter-rouge">div</code>? I’ve already challenged myself on <a href="front-in-floripa-logo-css/">Front in Floripa logo</a>.</p>

<p>So I started, and guess what? The first trial was not so successful. When I realized the complexity of the drawing, I had to delete everything and it starts from scratch.</p>

<p>It took about 1 hour to finish everything but I could do it. I think if I didn’t want to use only one div, probably I would do it faster. And for sure, there is way to do it without using <code class="highlighter-rouge">:before</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">:after</code> but my CSS knowledge is not so good yet.</p>
