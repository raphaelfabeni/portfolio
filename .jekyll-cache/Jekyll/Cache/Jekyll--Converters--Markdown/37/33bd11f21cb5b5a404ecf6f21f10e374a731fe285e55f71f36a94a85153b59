I"›<p>A user, in most cases, access a website for a <strong>objective</strong>: searching the last numbers of lottery, print some medical results or even ask something to eat. Itâ€™s your (or ours) objective to think in the best way/experience in how the user will do that.</p>

<p>Talking more, not about of how the experience will be projected but about in what maybe would be the focus of the <em>whole thing</em>: the information or content that user looks for. Something that in most cases is abandoned and which only has due attention when the problems starts to appear.</p>

<p>In a world of digital projects not so distant, what happens frequently is related to <em>itâ€™s not my responsibility</em>. So, a website area needs to finalize the content and:</p>

<ul>
  <li>area X says itâ€™s not responsibility of it and that is part of area Y work.</li>
  <li>however, the area Y says that does not make sense they take care of it and that could be demand of area Z.</li>
  <li>the area Z says that itâ€™s not with them, but they could help. However they are really busy and it could take some time..</li>
</ul>

<p>So we can predict the outcome of this <em>seesaw</em>: content came out worse than the current Brazilian soccer team.</p>

<h2 id="a-real-case-the-reward">A real case: the reward</h2>

<p>I only stay motivated to write briefly about it because it happened with me recently the problem of <em>content out of date</em>. I had some points in my credit card and I needed to chance for some benefit as I would cancel my credit cards. So, I made a simple research (because I did not have so much points), and made a <strong>choice</strong>: I changed something mine, for a <strong>reward</strong>.</p>

<p>The idea of <em>reward</em> is a important thing, because I, as a user, felt excited in could <em>earning</em> something, even if it is from a change of points.</p>

<p>The reward was nothing more than some credits that I could use in some establishments. The company has a website with some informations about the <em>program</em>, amongst them a map that showed the address of the establishments. So, I got some addresses from places near of my house and guess what? Two of them <strong>did not know</strong> about the program and one <strong>did not even exist</strong>.</p>

<p>I made contact with the company and they said that they were taking the necessary actions and they apologize for the troubles. I told them that all that mess was an absurd but that I believe that a had a bad luck and I could try again in another region. So I did it and guess what? The establishments wall all closed with wood plates (probably a new construction).</p>

<p>Seems like a joke right? But itâ€™s not. What I thought about all of it is that something which <strong>experience would be great</strong> because I was using a <em>benefit/reward</em>, became totally the oposite. I, as user, as soon as use my benefit (I hope soon), I intend to never come back to use the services of the company.</p>

<p>Do you like it? Did I write something stupid? Do you want to improve? Open an <a href="https://github.com/raphaelfabeni/raphaelfabeni.github.io/issues">issue</a> mentioning the post and letâ€™s talk about it.</p>
