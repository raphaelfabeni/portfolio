I"â<p>Something I donâ€™t like is a pre-concept about some technology before I try it. For a couple of months, Iâ€™ve been trying Stylus and I have to say Iâ€™m liking a lot. One type of CSS architecture I really like is BEM and these days I faced a simple problem that probably most of you resolved but as it was new for me I decided to post here.</p>

<h2 id="the-scenario-with-bem">The scenario with BEM</h2>

<p>Imagine there is a superclass <code class="highlighter-rouge">.fabeni</code> and it has a child element and a modificator class (if you want to know more about BEM, <a href="bem-css-overview/">I wrote some stuff some time ago</a> ). Something like that:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/825928e16238207cdd3518ae09abd009.js"> </script>

<p>Hereâ€™s the thing: letâ€™s say we want to target the child element of the modificator class, something like:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/0ee8688543375828e43127e1ae0034f8.js"> </script>

<p>Using Stylus, I realized three different ways we could write it (probably there is more).</p>

<h3 id="rewriting-the-parent-class">Rewriting the parent class</h3>

<p>I have to confess that Iâ€™ve already done that. Itâ€™s ok! Itâ€™s not so beautiful but it works.</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/3845caad6009514cd748a2f7d271dff7.js"> </script>

<h3 id="holding-the-main-class-in-a-variable">Holding the main class in a variable</h3>

<p>Using this preprocessor feature, easily we could reuse the class.</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/b236e216a8ea80afe68f240e053be3e2.js"> </script>

<h3 id="targeting-dynamically-the-parent-class">Targeting dynamically the parent class</h3>

<p>And <em>booom</em>! Itâ€™s possible to target the parent class using the magic <code class="highlighter-rouge">^[0]</code>.</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/55163c8dac19ea0ead80f6cf1397925f.js"> </script>

<p>I donâ€™t know exactly which Stylusâ€™ version supports it, but itâ€™s a good homework (I tested directly on the Stylus website).</p>
