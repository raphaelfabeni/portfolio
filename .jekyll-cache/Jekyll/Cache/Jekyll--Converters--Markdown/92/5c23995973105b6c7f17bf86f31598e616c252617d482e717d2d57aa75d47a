I"<p>CSS3 was already something really cool. Now, in version 4, or better saying, in <em>level 4</em>, as it will be divided from now, CSS has much more features. One of them is the <code class="highlighter-rouge">:matches</code> selector.</p>

<p>Using it, we could substitute something like that:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/a7b5fc0e8c7d2f5edb983b791adef64d.js"> </script>

<p>For that:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/eb85105186b637f39141eb60db5d6593.js"> </script>

<p>In other words, we get every <code class="highlighter-rouge">highlight</code> class that are children of a <code class="highlighter-rouge">div</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">footer</code>.</p>

<p>We could even make the inverse way, as in the example below: we select all <code class="highlighter-rouge">p</code> elements that have the <code class="highlighter-rouge">success</code> class or that is <code class="highlighter-rouge">first-child</code>.</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/5d1e3a873bec33562147be84f0eab917.js"> </script>
