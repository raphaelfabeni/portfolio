<p>Even if you did not work with technology or digital projects, probably you could have heard about the <em>10 usability heuristics of Jakob Nielsen</em>. In summary, are 10 items for a usability evaluation of a website with the purpose to avoid common mistakes.</p>

<p>One of these, and really nice, is about to prevent <em>user errors</em>. Directly: it’s great to show an alert or a message for the user about the error, but could be better if we could avoid these errors.</p>

<p>One that I remembered and which helped me several times is writing an email in <em>Gmail</em>. If we had the word <em>attachment</em> (in portuguese works with <em>anexo</em>) in the email body, and there is any attachment file, so Gmail shows an <em>alert</em> to user asking if he/she forgot to attach the file.</p>

<p>With this idea in mind, we could do a lot of cool things, mainly in forms.</p>

<h2 id="going-further">Going further</h2>

<p>So, we talk primarily about <em>real time</em> actions, which users make an action and the system responds immediately, or to avoid the error or to guide the user on the right way.</p>

<p>But if we think in long-term, when we could have some registered users in our system, app or whatever. Can we not prevent them from possible actions to be made? <em>Ahn?! Man, what are you talking about?</em></p>

<p>Let’s go there. Nothing better than use an real world example that occurred with me last week. I use an app which you need to register some documents. When you do that, you must put a <em>expiration date</em> related to the document. However, I believe that has already happened to most people, to forget a possible due date or pay attention to it the next day.</p>

<p>In summary: the due date of one of my documents had expired and I did not realize that. So, one day I tried to start the app and I couldn’t because a message showed for me that one of my documents was expired. So, in the same hour, I updated the document, because I had the new version, but I did not had uploaded in the app system. However I couldn’t use the app because the app took some time to validate the document.</p>

<p>This can be just a crazy idea of my mind, because in fact, the error was mine, but I was extremely angry with the situation and the first thing that I thought was: <em>“the app could have warned me..”</em>.</p>

<p>Do you like it? Did I write something stupid? Do you want to improve? Open an <a href="https://github.com/raphaelfabeni/raphaelfabeni.github.io/issues">issue</a> mentioning the post and let’s talk about it.</p>
