I"<p>I met great <em>destructuring assignment</em> through my brother <a href="https://twitter.com/_weslleyaraujo">Weslley Araujo</a>, and I need to confess that I really liked. It is nothing more than an expression that allows us to <em>get</em> data from <em>objects</em> or <em>arrays</em> of a much simpler way.</p>

<p>For we get a property of an object, we could do something like that:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/eb197d540533622a63ce90c26bd725bd.js"> </script>

<p>With the <em>new guy</em>, we could do something like that:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/7a17dc39fcc58c42fe407e343900dc82.js"> </script>

<h2 id="with-arrays">With arrays</h2>

<p>If we wanted to take the first item of an <code class="highlighter-rouge">array</code>, we could do something like:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/5d04833fa61c5e9bbbe1685f8e163ad5.js"> </script>

<p>With the <em>fella</em> <em>destructuring</em>, we could do:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/2271f2f884142224df2b1b040d9dbbc8.js"> </script>

<p>It is still possible, play a bit more:</p>

<h2 id="using-when-importing-files">Using when importing files</h2>

<p>A very cool thing to use <em>destructuring assignment</em> is when we need to import <em>things</em> to our files. Imagine we have a generic file, as a <em>helpers</em>, something like that:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/fea8d5b641ddfca3676a4c0dca5e1ddb.js"> </script>

<p>Nice! In other file, let’s suppose that we need only these two functions, and not the entire file. So, let’s go:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/009dda7f95d0ce2399613469cef4e117.js"> </script>

<h2 id="applying-to-foreach">Applying to <code class="highlighter-rouge">forEach</code></h2>

<p>We could use to in the famous <code class="highlighter-rouge">forEach</code>. So, if we have a data like that:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/5d3357bc4414754bc542dbb597535432.js"> </script>

<p>With this data, normally we could do something like that:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/0f6bf72833c65ebc62c165c367cbf3ae.js"> </script>

<p>With the double of <a href="/es6-arrow-functions">arrow-functions</a> and <em>destructuring</em>, we got some powers:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/2abae3213f2d8e50f263618f2276642c.js"> </script>

<h2 id="creating-objects">Creating objects</h2>

<p>We could create objects in this way:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/ca845aa1bf2787f1e938ba74bf4b8022.js"> </script>

<p>But there is a new way much more fun. <em>◕‿◕</em></p>
