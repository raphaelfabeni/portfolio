I"<p>Some time ago, I presented a talk at FrontinSampa about tips of CSS and one of the topics was about a check animation that I tried to do using only CSS.</p>

<p>I tried in different ways and it’s funny because when you’re developing and animating in CSS you need to think like CSS even doing that be something really strange.</p>

<p>So, the first thing was to draw the check: the basic idea was to create a rectangle w/ borders and remove two of them making like a letter L. After that we only use the <code class="highlighter-rouge">rotate</code> and we have the check.</p>

<p>So, now it’s the fun part: how to make the animation? The first thing that I thought was how to animate the borders? So, after a while, I realized that I should think different. Basically, I’ve drawn a rectangle, so I had to animate the shape: <code class="highlighter-rouge">width</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">height</code>.</p>

<p>The animation is simple and only animates these two properties plus the <code class="highlighter-rouge">opacity</code> to make it cooler. To finish, we just change the <code class="highlighter-rouge">origin</code> of <code class="highlighter-rouge">transform</code> to let the check centralized during the animation.</p>
