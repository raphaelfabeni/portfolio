We could pass some parameters in functions, right? Okay. With ES6 it is possible assign default values for them if they are not passed.

When we create a function, we could verify that the values were passed or not, and maybe assign a value to it; something like that.

```js
function oldHello(name, nickname) {
  var name = (!name) ? 'James Bond' : name;
  var nickname = (!nickname) ? 'Bond' : nickname;
  
  console.log('My name is ' + nickname + ', ' + name);
}

oldHello();
// My name is Bond, James Bond
```

Now, we could do something like that:

```js
function hello(name = 'James Bond', nickname = 'Bond') {
  console.log('My name is ' + nickname + ', ' + name);
}

hello();
// My name is Bond, James Bond
```

Do you like it? Did I write something stupid? Do you want to improve? Open an [issue](https://github.com/raphaelfabeni/raphaelfabeni.github.io/issues) mentioning the post and let's talk about it.
