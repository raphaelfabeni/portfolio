The *spread* guy allow us extract/expand data from an array make our lifes easier. Confused? I guess I could not explain. Go to practice. Imagine the following arrays:

```js
let mortalKombat = ['Scorpion', 'Sub Zero', 'Liu Kang'];
let newCharacters = ['Reptile', 'Kitana'];
```

If we had to add the new *fighters* to the main *array*, we could try something like that:

```js
mortalKombat.push(newCharacters);

console.log(mortalKombat);
// ['Scorpion', 'Sub Zero', 'Liu Kang', ['Reptile', 'Kitana']]
```

The data is there, but not in the way that we want. So we need to manipulate it before:

```js
newCharacters.forEach(function(fighter) {
  mortalKombat.push(fighter);
});

console.log(mortalKombat);
// ['Scorpion', 'Sub Zero', 'Liu Kang', 'Reptile', 'Kitana']
```

The operator *spread* arrives making magic and leaving everything beautiful.

```js
mortalKombat.push(...newCharacters);

console.log(mortalKombat);
// ['Scorpion', 'Sub Zero', 'Liu Kang', 'Reptile', 'Kitana']
```
