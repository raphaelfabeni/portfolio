CSS3 was already something really cool. Now, in version 4, or better saying, in *level 4*, as it will be divided from now, CSS has much more features. One of them is the `:matches` selector.

Using it, we could substitute something like that:

```css
div .highlight,
footer .highlight {
  color: blue;
}
```

For that:

```css
:matches(div, footer) .highlight {
  color: blue;
}
```

In other words, we get every `highlight` class that are children of a `div` or `footer`.

We could even make the inverse way, as in the example below: we select all `p` elements that have the `success` class or that is `first-child`.

```css
p:matches(:first-child, .success) {
  color: green;
}
```
